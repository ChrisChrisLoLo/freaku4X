A 4x10 ortho keyboard with a knob and OLED



## Status
Prototyping phase. While possible to print and use right now, a few refinements can be made.
Right now, the knob button needs to be placed on the key matrix, and I wouldprefer to rotate the keys around so that hotswap is southfacing.

With that said, this keyboard in it's current form is usable with some amount of tinkering
