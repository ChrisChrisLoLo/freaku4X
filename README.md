A 4x10 ortho keyboard with a knob and OLED. It embraces the excess minimalism of the key count, and embraces the excess extravagence of a knob and oled screen. It also has a lower profile than your typical 4x10 orthos, since the microcontroller is facing upwards rather than downwards.

## Status
Prototyping phase. While possible to print and use right now, a few refinements can be made.
Right now, the knob button needs to be placed on the key matrix, and I wouldprefer to rotate the keys around so that hotswap is southfacing.

With that said, this keyboard in it's current form is usable with some amount of tinkering

Thank you to [PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/) for allowing me to experiment and create wild board designs that I wouldn't be able to prototype without their support. PCBWay has always been super friendly with their service, and the quality of thier boards are great, so I do recommend using their services. The've also been supporting the custom pcb keyboard community for a while, allowing for the hobby to continue to flourish.
